# Classy Weather 🌤️

**Classy Weather** is a clean, component‑driven React single‑page application that fetches and displays current weather and short‑term forecasts for user‑selected locations. It’s built as a practical portfolio project demonstrating API integration, component composition, and responsive UI patterns.

## Overview

**Purpose:** let users search for a location (city or geolocation), view current weather details (temperature, humidity, wind, conditions), and see a short forecast. The app emphasizes clarity, accessibility, and a small, maintainable codebase.

**Intended audience:** frontend developers learning API integration and state management, or anyone who wants a minimal, production‑ready weather UI to extend.

## Key features

- **Search by city** and optional geolocation lookup.
- **Current weather**: temperature, feels like, humidity, wind, and condition text/icon.
- **Short forecast** cards (hourly or multi‑day depending on API).
- **Responsive UI** for mobile and desktop.
- **Error handling** and user feedback for network/API issues.
- **Environment configuration** for API keys (keeps secrets out of source control).
